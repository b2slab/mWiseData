Description: mWiseData contains the benchmark datasets used for validation 
    in mWISE annotation algorithm.
    They consist of untargeted LC-MS datasets containing both positive
    and negative acquisition modes, as well as, the input peak lists
    and the reference peak to compound assignations.
    Three different datasets are available: two of them contain human 
    urine samples and the other one contains Trypanosoma brucei samples.
