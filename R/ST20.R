#' @description
#' This study was aimed at evaluating the impact of the physiological
#' factors gender, age and body mass index in humans urine metabolome.
#' The identifications reported by this study were achieved by at
#' least comparing two physicochemical parameters to those of a
#' reference compound (level 2 identification).
#' It consists of a list containing
#' the positive (\code{Positive}) acquisition mode data and the
#' negative (\code{Negative}) acquisition mode data. Within each
#' element, a list of length 2 is available, which contains the
#' input peak list (\code{Input}) and the reference peak to compound
#' assignations (\code{Output}).
#' @usage data(ST20)
#' @format An object of class list of length 2.
